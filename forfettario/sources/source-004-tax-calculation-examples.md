### Tax Rate Structure
- **Standard Rate**: 15% flat tax on taxable income
- **Startup Rate**: 5% for new business activities (first 5 years)
- **Effective Rates**: 
  - With 15% rate: approximately 11.7% of gross income (varies by ATECO code)
  - With 5% rate: approximately 3.9% of gross turnover

### Calculation Method
1. **Apply Profitability Coefficient**: Based on ATECO code
2. **Calculate Taxable Income**: Gross turnover × coefficient
3. **Apply Tax Rate**: 15% or 5% on taxable income

### Detailed Calculation Example - Professional Doctor
- **ATECO Code**: 86.22.01
- **Total Annual Compensation**: €50,000
- **Professional Fund Payments**: €10,000
- **Taxable Income**: (€50,000 × 78%) - €10,000 = €29,000
- **Tax Applied**: 15% or 5% on €29,000

### Practical Example - IT Technician

- **Forfettario Net**: €23,286 (after tax and contributions)
- **Ordinary Taxation Net**: €17,286 (approximately €6,000 less)
- **Savings**: Significant advantage with forfettario

### Social Security Contributions
