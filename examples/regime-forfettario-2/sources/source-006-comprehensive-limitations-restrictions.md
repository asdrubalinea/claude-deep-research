## Key Information

### Revenue and Income Limits
- Annual revenue must not exceed €85,000
- If revenue exceeds €100,000 during the year, immediate switch to standard tax regime required
- If revenue between €85,000-€100,000, can continue until year-end but must switch the following year
- Employment income (if also an employee) must be less than €30,000 (€35,000 for 2026)

### Staff and Business Restrictions

- Cannot hold more than 25% of shares in companies with similar activities
- Cannot be members of partnerships, professional associations, or limited liability companies

### Former Employer Restrictions
- Invoices to former employers cannot exceed 50% of total annual revenue
- Designed to prevent tax evasion through false self-employment

### Major Disadvantages

#### Cannot Deduct Actual Expenses

- Only lump-sum deduction according to coefficients (typically 22% or 33% based on ATECO code)
- Significant disadvantage for expense-heavy businesses

#### VAT Recovery Limitations
- Cannot recover VAT on purchases (stationery, IT equipment, telecommunications, etc.)
- All VAT on business purchases becomes a non-recoverable cost

#### Limited Tax Deductions
- Cannot claim standard deductions (alimony, medical bills, mortgage interest, home improvement incentives)
- Only applies unless taxpayer has other income sources
- Due to substitute tax nature rather than IRPEF

### Administrative Burdens
- Must attach €2 stamp to each invoice exceeding €77.47
- Can be done online but administratively burdensome for low-volume invoicers

### Social Security Considerations
- No reduction in social security contribution rates
- Liable for both flat rate tax (5%/15%) and Italian social security contributions

### Activity and Residency Restrictions
- Must be Italian resident (exception: non-residents with 75% Italian income)
- Cannot engage in real estate, developable land, or new vehicle sales
- Cannot operate under other special regimes or special VAT regimes

### Complexity and Risk Assessment
