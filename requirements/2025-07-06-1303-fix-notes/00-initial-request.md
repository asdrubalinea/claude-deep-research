Claude Deep Research fix notes

Specify in the prompt to ask user questions to further clarify their needs, so that Claude can provide more accurate results.

In general, make sure the best practices are followed (https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices), for instance, using the ultrathink keyword for Phase 1 and Phase 2, make sure every command has a description and a list of allowed-tools.

Try to improve the prompts overall, make them shorter if needed, follow the guidelines.

Make sure that Claude is using the integrated search tool, and that Claude is performing multiple searches with subagents if possible.
