# Expert Detail Questions for Deep Research System Improvements

Based on my deep analysis of the codebase, here are the five most critical implementation questions:

## Q1: Should clarifying questions in each phase be mandatory (blocking) or optional (skippable with defaults)?
**Default if unknown:** Optional (allows users to skip questions and use smart defaults for faster workflow)

## Q2: When implementing parallel searches in Phase 2, should we limit concurrent operations to 5 to avoid rate limiting issues?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (based on common API rate limits and WebSearch best practices)

## Q3: Should the ultrathink keyword be automatically inserted by commands or require users to explicitly include it in their queries?
**Default if unknown:** Automatic (commands should add ultrathink at appropriate decision points without user intervention)

## Q4: Should existing sessions created before these improvements remain compatible with the updated prompts?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintain backward compatibility to preserve existing research sessions)

## Q5: Should the system validate that all command files have proper metadata (description, allowed-tools) before execution?
**Default if unknown:** No (validation might slow down execution; better to trust proper implementation)
