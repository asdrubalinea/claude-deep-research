# Initial Request

**Date:** 2025-07-05 21:49
**Request:** This project is a bit hard to use since it requires copying promps. Please modify it while taking inspiration from how ./claude-code-requirements-builder is doing.

## Problem Statement
The current deep-research system requires users to manually copy prompts from markdown files, which creates friction and makes the system hard to use. The user wants to improve usability by taking inspiration from the claude-code-requirements-builder approach.

## Context
- Current system: Manual prompt copying from prompts/ directory
- Reference implementation: ./claude-code-requirements-builder (appears to use slash commands)
- Goal: Improve usability while maintaining the four-phase research workflow
