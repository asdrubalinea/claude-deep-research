# Discovery Questions

These questions will help understand the specific requirements for your custom Deep Research system.

## Q1: Will your research agent primarily focus on analyzing publicly available web content?
**Default if unknown:** No (based on INSTRUCTIONS.md emphasis on proprietary data integration via MCP)

## Q2: Do you need the system to access and analyze local files and proprietary databases?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (this is a key differentiator mentioned in the blueprint)

## Q3: Will the research agent need to execute code for data analysis and visualization?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (the blueprint emphasizes multi-modal analysis capabilities)

## Q4: Should the system include human-in-the-loop checkpoints for critical decisions?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (for maximum accuracy and control as suggested in the blueprint)

## Q5: Will you need the agent to generate interactive reports with visualizations?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (Claude Artifacts capability is highlighted as superior to plain text)
