# Requirements Update: Claude Code Direct Implementation

## Change Summary
User prefers to use Claude Code directly with crafted prompts rather than a Python orchestrator. This approach leverages Claude Code's native capabilities and keeps the human more involved in the research process.

## Key Changes:
1. **Remove Python Orchestrator**: No external Python scripts needed
2. **Prompt-Based Workflow**: Use carefully crafted prompts for each research phase
3. **Claude Code Native**: Leverage built-in tools (WebSearch, WebFetch, file operations)
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Natural pauses between prompt executions
5. **Simpler Architecture**: Focus on prompts, templates, and documentation

## Updated Approach:
- Research is conducted through a series of Claude Code conversations
- Each phase uses a specific prompt template
- Human reviews and approves before proceeding to next phase
- Results are saved as files for continuity between phases
- Final report generated using Claude Artifacts

## Benefits:
- No external dependencies beyond Claude Code
- More transparent process with human oversight at each step
- Easier to modify and customize prompts
- Leverages Claude's full conversational capabilities
- Natural checkpoints without programmatic interrupts
