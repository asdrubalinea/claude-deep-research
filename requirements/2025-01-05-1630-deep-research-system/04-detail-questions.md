# Expert Detail Questions

These questions address specific implementation details now that we understand the technical landscape.

## Q6: Should the system automatically filter out sources based on domain reputation (e.g., prioritize .edu, .gov, exclude known unreliable sites)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (improves research quality by enforcing source credibility)

## Q7: Will the research agent need to handle authentication-protected content (e.g., sites requiring login)?
**Default if unknown:** No (adds complexity and security risks, focus on publicly accessible content)

## Q8: Should the system cache scraped web content to avoid re-fetching during the same research session?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (improves performance and reduces load on target websites)

## Q9: Do you want the orchestrator to use a cheaper Claude model (Sonnet) for intermediate tasks and reserve Opus for final synthesis?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (optimizes costs while maintaining quality for the final output)

## Q10: Should the system maintain a persistent memory of previous research sessions using an MCP memory server?
**Default if unknown:** No (adds complexity, start with stateless operation for simplicity)
