# Deep Research File Structure Modification - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## Summary

Successfully implemented the requested file structure changes to modify Deep Research from using a centralized `sessions/` directory to using user-created directories with reusable sources.

This document summarizes the complete implementation of the file structure modifications for the Deep Research System.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. **Directory Structure Transformation**

**Before (Old Structure):**
```
deep-research/
└── sessions/
    ├── .current-research
    └── YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-slug/
        ├── metadata.json
        ├── 01-plan.md
        ├── 02-sources/
        ├── 03-findings.md
        └── 04-report.html
```

**After (New Structure):**
```
[user-directory]/
├── .deep-research/              # Hidden directory for session metadata
│   ├── .current-research        # Active session tracker
│   └── sessions/                # Session metadata storage
│       └── [session-id]/
│           └── metadata.json
├── sources/                     # Shared source collection
│   ├── source-001-*.md
│   └── source-inventory.md
├── [session-id]-plan.md         # Session-specific files
├── [session-id]-findings.md
└── [session-id]-report.html
```

### 2. **Modified Command Files**

Successfully updated all 5 Deep Research command files:

#### ✅ `/commands/research-start.md`
- Changed session directory creation from `sessions/[SESSION_ID]` to `.deep-research/sessions/[SESSION_ID]`
- Updated global state file location to `.deep-research/.current-research`
- Added source detection logic to find and validate existing sources
- Modified file paths to use session ID prefixes (e.g., `[SESSION_ID]-plan.md`)
- Added logic to create shared `sources/` directory

#### ✅ `/commands/research-status.md`
- Updated to read `.deep-research/.current-research` instead of `sessions/.current-research`
- Modified session metadata path construction to use new structure
- Updated source directory references from `02-sources/` to `sources/`
- Changed file references to use session ID prefixes

#### ✅ `/commands/research-current.md`
- Updated session discovery to use `.deep-research/.current-research`
- Modified file path construction for new directory structure
- Updated file existence checks for session-specific files
- Changed source directory references

#### ✅ `/commands/research-list.md`
- Modified session discovery to scan `.deep-research/sessions/` directory
- Updated global state file location
- Changed session directory scanning logic

#### ✅ `/commands/research-end.md`
- Updated session finalization to use new directory structure
- Modified file path references for session-specific files
- Updated archival structure documentation
- Changed cleanup logic for new global state location

### 3. **Legacy Prompt Update**

#### ✅ `/prompts/PHASE-1-PLANNING.md`
- Updated file path reference from `sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-[topic]/01-plan.md` to `[SESSION_ID]-plan.md`

### 4. **New Features Implemented**

#### **Source Detection and Reuse**
- System automatically detects existing source files in `sources/` directory
- Users can manually add sources outside of Deep Research workflow
- Sources are validated and indexed when starting new sessions
- Multiple research sessions share the same source collection

#### **User Directory-Based Operations**
- Research sessions created in user's current working directory
- No need for users to specify directory paths
- Each directory can have its own active research session
- Metadata stored in hidden `.deep-research` directory for clean user experience

#### **Session ID-Based File Naming**
- Session-specific files use consistent naming: `[SESSION_ID]-plan.md`, `[SESSION_ID]-findings.md`, etc.
- Enables multiple research sessions in same directory
- Clear file organization and identification

## Integration with Existing System

### Metadata Integration
All commands work with the existing metadata.json structure:
- Session identification and tracking
- Progress monitoring across phases
- Source quality tracking
- Research coverage analysis
- Time and activity metrics

### File System Integration
Commands operate on the established directory structure:
```
sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-slug/
├── metadata.json
├── 01-plan.md
├── 02-sources/
├── 03-findings.md
└── 04-report.html
```

### Workflow Integration
Commands integrate with the four-phase research methodology:
1. **Phase 1 - Planning**: research-start command
2. **Phase 2 - Gathering**: research-status workflow
3. **Phase 3 - Analysis**: research-status workflow
4. **Phase 4 - Report**: research-end finalization

### State Management
Commands maintain consistency with global state:
- .current-research file tracking
- TodoWrite integration for progress tracking
- Session status synchronization
- File system validation

## Command Execution Flow

### research-current Workflow
1. Validate active session existence
2. Load and parse session metadata
3. Analyze file system and calculate metrics
4. Display comprehensive session overview
5. Provide phase-specific recommendations

### research-list Workflow
1. Discover all session directories
2. Load metadata for each valid session
3. Categorize sessions by status
4. Sort and organize session data
5. Display formatted session directory

### research-end Workflow
1. Validate active session and load data
2. Analyze session completion status
3. Present finalization options to user
4. Execute chosen finalization process
5. Generate final report (if completing)
6. Update metadata and clear global state
7. Display completion summary
