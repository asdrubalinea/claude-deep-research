## Integration with Existing System

### Metadata Integration
All commands work with the existing metadata.json structure:
- Session identification and tracking
- Progress monitoring across phases
- Source quality tracking
- Research coverage analysis
- Time and activity metrics

### File System Integration
Commands operate on the established directory structure:
```
sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-slug/
├── metadata.json
├── 01-plan.md
├── 02-sources/
├── 03-findings.md
└── 04-report.html
```

### Workflow Integration
Commands integrate with the four-phase research methodology:
1. **Phase 1 - Planning**: research-start command
2. **Phase 2 - Gathering**: research-status workflow
3. **Phase 3 - Analysis**: research-status workflow
4. **Phase 4 - Report**: research-end finalization

### State Management
Commands maintain consistency with global state:
- .current-research file tracking
- TodoWrite integration for progress tracking
- Session status synchronization
- File system validation

## Command Execution Flow

### research-current Workflow
1. Validate active session existence
2. Load and parse session metadata
3. Analyze file system and calculate metrics
4. Display comprehensive session overview
5. Provide phase-specific recommendations

### research-list Workflow
1. Discover all session directories
2. Load metadata for each valid session
3. Categorize sessions by status
4. Sort and organize session data
5. Display formatted session directory

### research-end Workflow
1. Validate active session and load data
2. Analyze session completion status
3. Present finalization options to user
4. Execute chosen finalization process
5. Generate final report (if completing)
6. Update metadata and clear global state
7. Display completion summary
