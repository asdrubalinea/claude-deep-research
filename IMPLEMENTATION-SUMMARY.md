## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Start Research**: Open Claude Code and paste the Phase 1 prompt with your question
2. **Follow Phases**: Progress through each phase with human review
3. **Save Results**: Each phase saves its output for continuity
4. **Generate Report**: Phase 4 creates an interactive HTML artifact

## 🔑 Key Features Implemented

### Phase 1 - Planning
- Decomposes queries into 5-7 sub-questions
- Creates structured research plans
- Saves to session directory
- Human approval checkpoint

### Phase 2 - Gathering  
- Systematic web searching
- Source quality filtering
- Content extraction and saving
- Citation tracking
- Source inventory creation

### Phase 3 - Analysis
- Reads all gathered sources
- Extracts key findings
- Identifies patterns
- Cross-references information
- Creates comprehensive analysis

### Phase 4 - Report
- Professional HTML generation
- Interactive elements
- Complete citations
- Executive summary
- Collapsible sections

## 📋 Quality Assurance

- **Ethical Guidelines**: Responsible web scraping practices
- **Citation Standards**: Consistent citation format
- **Human Checkpoints**: Review at each phase
- **Progress Tracking**: TodoWrite integration
- **State Management**: Files maintain context

## 🎯 Ready for Use

The system is now ready for research tasks. To begin:

1. Read `README.md` for usage instructions
2. Review `CLAUDE.md` for best practices
3. Start with the Phase 1 prompt
4. Follow the four-phase workflow

## 💡 Tips

- Keep research questions focused but open-ended
- Review and modify plans before execution
- Request additional sources if needed
- Save important artifacts for reference
- Use the templates for consistency

The implementation follows the approved requirements specification and uses Claude Code's native capabilities without external dependencies.
