## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Validate Active Session
```
CURRENT_SESSION_FILE = ".deep-research/.current-research"
if not file_exists(CURRENT_SESSION_FILE):
    display_error("No active research session to end.")
    display_message("Use `/research-list` to see all available sessions")
    exit

ACTIVE_SESSION_ID = read_file(CURRENT_SESSION_FILE).strip()
if empty(ACTIVE_SESSION_ID):
    display_error("No active session ID found.")
    exit

SESSION_META_DIR = ".deep-research/sessions/" + ACTIVE_SESSION_ID
METADATA_FILE = SESSION_META_DIR + "/metadata.json"
```

### Step 2: Load Current Session State
```
if not file_exists(METADATA_FILE):
    display_error("Session metadata not found. Session may be corrupted.")
    exit

METADATA = parse_json(read_file(METADATA_FILE))
CURRENT_PHASE = METADATA.phase
CURRENT_STATUS = METADATA.status
```

### Step 3: Analyze Session Completion
```
// Perform comprehensive session validation in parallel
VALIDATION_TASKS = [
    validate_plan_file(SESSION_DIR),
    validate_sources_directory(SESSION_DIR),
    validate_findings_file(SESSION_DIR),
    validate_report_file(SESSION_DIR),
    validate_citations(SESSION_DIR)
]

## ultrathink
Session completion analysis requires thorough evaluation of research quality, completeness, and adherence to standards to ensure the research meets publication criteria.

COMPLETION_ANALYSIS = run_parallel_validation(VALIDATION_TASKS)
SESSION_COMPLETE = COMPLETION_ANALYSIS.isComplete
MISSING_ELEMENTS = COMPLETION_ANALYSIS.missingElements
QUALITY_ISSUES = COMPLETION_ANALYSIS.qualityIssues
```

### Step 4: Present Session Summary and Get User Confirmation
```
display_session_summary(METADATA, COMPLETION_ANALYSIS)
if not SESSION_COMPLETE:
    display_completion_warnings(MISSING_ELEMENTS, QUALITY_ISSUES)
    
USER_CHOICE = prompt_user_finalization_choice()
// Options: complete-anyway, abandon, continue-research, force-end
```

### Step 5: Execute Finalization Based on User Choice
```
switch USER_CHOICE:
    case "complete-anyway":
        execute_completion_finalization()
    case "abandon":
        execute_abandonment_finalization()
    case "continue-research":
        display_continuation_guidance()
        exit
    case "force-end":
        execute_force_finalization()
```

### Step 6: Generate Final Report (if completing)
```
if USER_CHOICE in ["complete-anyway", "force-end"]:
    FINAL_REPORT = generate_final_report(METADATA, SESSION_DIR)
    save_final_report(FINAL_REPORT, SESSION_DIR)
```

### Step 7: Update Session Metadata
```
FINALIZED_METADATA = update_final_metadata(METADATA, USER_CHOICE)
save_metadata(FINALIZED_METADATA, METADATA_FILE)
```

### Step 8: Clear Global State
```
delete_file(CURRENT_SESSION_FILE)
update_todo_completion()
```

### Step 9: Generate Learning Insights with Memory & Sequential Thinking
```
// Use Sequential Thinking for comprehensive session analysis
start_thinking("Analyzing session performance and extracting learnings")

continue_thinking("""
Let me systematically analyze this research session:
1. What worked well in terms of methodology and approach?
2. Which search strategies yielded the highest quality sources?
3. What patterns can I identify in user preferences and decisions?
4. How efficient was the research process compared to similar sessions?
5. What improvements could be made for future sessions?
6. What domain-specific insights can inform future research in this area?
""")

SESSION_ANALYSIS = finish_thinking()

// Extract learnings and store in persistent memory
LEARNING_INSIGHTS = generate_session_insights(FINALIZED_METADATA, SESSION_DIR, SESSION_ANALYSIS)
IMPROVEMENT_SUGGESTIONS = analyze_research_quality(LEARNING_INSIGHTS)
FUTURE_RECOMMENDATIONS = extract_methodology_learnings(SESSION_DIR)

// Store comprehensive learnings in memory for future sessions
create_memory_entry("session_completion", {
    session_id: SESSION_ID,
    domain: METADATA.research_domain,
    quality_score: calculate_quality_score(LEARNING_INSIGHTS),
    successful_strategies: IMPROVEMENT_SUGGESTIONS.successful_patterns,
    lessons_learned: SESSION_ANALYSIS,
    user_preferences: extract_user_preferences(METADATA)
})

update_memory("research_patterns", {
    domain: METADATA.research_domain,
    methodology_improvements: FUTURE_RECOMMENDATIONS
})

save_learning_insights(LEARNING_INSIGHTS, SESSION_DIR)
display_finalization_summary(FINALIZED_METADATA, SESSION_DIR, LEARNING_INSIGHTS)
```
