# Research Guidelines for Deep Research System

## Overview
These guidelines apply to all phases of the deep research process. They ensure consistent, ethical, and high-quality research output while leveraging Claude Code's capabilities effectively.

## Core Research Principles

### 1. Objectivity and Balance
- Present multiple perspectives on controversial topics
- Acknowledge limitations and biases in sources
- Distinguish between facts, analysis, and opinion
- Avoid cherry-picking data to support predetermined conclusions
- Include dissenting views when relevant

### 2. Thoroughness
- Address all aspects of the research question
- Follow leads that emerge during research
- Identify and acknowledge knowledge gaps
- Go beyond surface-level information
- Connect findings across multiple sources

### 3. Accuracy
- Verify claims against multiple sources
- Check dates and currency of information
- Confirm statistical data and figures
- Validate expert credentials
- Cross-reference controversial claims

### 4. Transparency
- Document research methodology
- Explain source selection criteria
- Note any access limitations encountered
- Disclose potential conflicts of interest
- Maintain clear audit trail

## Ethical Guidelines for Web Research

### Respecting Website Policies
1. **Always respect robots.txt** - Do not fetch content from disallowed paths
2. **Honor rate limits** - Avoid rapid consecutive requests to same domain
3. **Check terms of service** - Some sites prohibit automated access
4. **Respect paywalls** - Do not attempt to bypass payment requirements
5. **Acknowledge copyright** - Use content within fair use guidelines

### Responsible Data Collection
1. **Minimize server load** - Cache content locally after first fetch
2. **Use specific searches** - Avoid broad crawling of entire sites
3. **Focus on public information** - Do not seek private or restricted data
4. **Avoid personal data** - Do not collect or store personal information
5. **Respect geographic restrictions** - Some content may be region-locked

### Ethical Use of Information
1. **Provide attribution** - Always cite sources properly
2. **Preserve context** - Do not misrepresent source material
3. **Respect embargoes** - Honor publication date restrictions
4. **Acknowledge licenses** - Note Creative Commons or other licenses
5. **Avoid plagiarism** - Summarize and synthesize rather than copy
